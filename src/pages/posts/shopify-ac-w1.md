**üö® PLEASE NOTE: THIS POST IS STILL WIP üö®**

## What is the Shopify app challenge?
The easiest way to explain what the Shopify app challenge is, is to have Shopify explain it themselves:

> Inspired by #BuildinPublic, this year‚Äôs challenge features eight weekly challenges related to building apps to help support merchants businesses through the Black Friday/Cyber Monday season. 
>
> ...Apps created during the Shopify App Challenge may also be featured in an exclusive Black Friday/Cyber Monday collection on the Shopify App Store.

## Why participate? and why blog about it?

To keep it short: I want to build a public app, and blogging might keep me accountable!

I've built private Shopify apps before, but they've always been 3rd party, and run off API tokens- this seems like a good opportunity 
to take the OAuth route, and see what building a public app looks like, regardless of what the end product is.

The blogs will mostly act as public notes as I work through each weeks challenges.

**That means that these pages might not be finished as you read them, so keep that in mind!**

## Brainstorming üß†‚õà
I'm taking a bit of a structured approach to brainstorming; my app ideas all solve problems that fall into one of the following categories:

1. **Experienced Problems**: App ideas that would solve a problem I've solved for a client on an invidual level previously (i.e customizable Vendor pages, better Blogging features, SEO friendly recipes etc )
2. **Known Problems**: App ideas that would solve problems I've heard of, but never experienced (i.e most ideas from the Shopify forums )
3. **Moon Shots**: Completely random ideas, that I think merchants might enjoy, but that aren't validated by anyone actually asking for them (i.e better customer account features)

## Focussing In üîç
TBD

## Tentative App Ideas
- **Vendorist:** Customizable vendor pages, Shopify already has this built in, but it's not highlighted much and would be good to be able to manage them from the admin.
- **Easy Wishlist:** Most wishlist apps on Shopify suck- this aims to be a simple, and actually usable wishlist for the customer, and allows the vendor to serve custom content to visitors
