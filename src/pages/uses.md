# Uses

A living document of the gear and tech I use day-to-day.

## What's Up With Uses?

It's a convenient way to list the gear you have, keep track of what you're using, and make it shareable with others, all in one place.

Check out everybody elses "/uses" page on [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) as well

## Desk Gear

This is where the large majority of my day-to-day gear lives.

- **Desk**: old door strapped to some generic sit/stand legs.
- **Keyboard**: Ducky One 2 SF with Cherry MX Browns, a 65% format keyboard with RGB.
- **Mouse**: Logitech G502 gaming mouse, another RGB goodie.
- **Monitors**: some older Dell monitors I got for free from my last job. I'm not sure what the model is but they're 1080p and good enough!

### Desktop Computer

- **CPU**: Intel I7 10700K @ 3.8GHz
- **CPU Cooler**: Corsair H60i AIO
- **RAM**: 32 GB (4 x 8GB) Corsair Vengeance RAM @ 3600MHz
- **GPU**: GTX 1660 Ti
- **SSD**: 256 GB ADATA SATA III
- **HDD**: 2TB Hard Drive (not sure, tbh)
- **PSU**: Corsair CX750F RGB
- **Case**: Corsair iCUE 5000X RGB Mid-Tower ATX

### NAS Server

My NAS is used for data storage and a bunch of dockerized applications (like NextCloud and some DataBases). It's mostly just a frankenstein of my first PC from 2012.

### Raspberry Pi Cluster

I have 3 Raspberry Pi 4Bs w/ 8gb of RAM I use for a Micro K8s cluster. More to come on this

## Misc

I'll add some more here soon!
