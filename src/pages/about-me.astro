        ## Professional
        Professionally, I write software. mostly web, besides that, idk- still figuring it out.
        I have a weird laundry list of technical skills including "modern" web, Shopify theme, and Backend dev. I've also been picking up some enterprise software skills [at UFV](/posts/new-job-at-ufv/).
        
        I like learning and solving technical problems, and just sort of follow whatever road that leads me down! _It's worked so far!_

        I also run a small consulting co all by my lonesome, so if you have a problem you want to solve, [check it out!](https://tinybox.dev) 

        ## Personal
        Just another white dude in tech.
        I like spending time with friends, and family (including my 2 cats), and doing general nerd things including: 
        1. Video Games
        2. Reading Sci-Fi, Horror, [and more](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141327631-mykal-machon)  
        3. Building fun > profit side projects (webapps, writing, etc.)
        4. Spending time with family and friends

        ## Education
        I graduated from the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV) with a Bachelor in Computer Information Systems in December of 2021.

        [UFV's BCIS degree](https://www.ufv.ca/computing/) is essentialy a mix of a traditional Computer Science Degree,
        with a number of other technical fields (Networking, IT, and Project Management) with a focus on projects and practical work experience.

        I also did a bit of AI research work while I was a student at UFV.
