I was talking with a friend yesterday about how I learned web dev.

They're just starting out in University, and were surprised to hear that I dont really attribute a lot of my technical knowledge to Uni classes.
So I made them a quick list of the web-dev resources I used to learn, and that I still use to learn!

> ‚Ñπ I'm still working on this one- it'll be updated over time.

## Video Courses üì∫
This is honestly where I've learned most of what I know in a "traditional" sense.

- [Wes Bos's Learn Node](https://learnnode.com): Comprehensive course that goes over what Node is, how it works, HTML templating, basic JS bundling, etc.
- [Wes Bos's Advanced React & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/): If you have some basic React knowledge, this tutorial takes it to the next level with Next.js, GraphQL, and friends!
- [Level Up Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com): React, Svelte, etc: All of Scott's content on Level Up Tuts is great!

## Podcasts üé§
I listen to podcasts to keep up on what's new & upcoming in web dev, as well as a way to nerd out about existing tech I haven't used:

- [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/): Just! build! WEBSITES! 
- [Syntax FM](https://syntax.fm): A relatively beginner oriented podcast hosted by Scott Tolinski, and Wes Bos! 
- [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty): Talking about Javascript and the web with a "party" of rotating hosts.
- [Remotely Interesting](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/09/01/announcing-a-remotely-interesting-podcast/): The Netlify dev rel team's podcast 

## Projects üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
This is where most of my practical knowledge came from- and where I recommend people spend most of their time!

- [Supastack](https://github.com/MykalMachon/Supastack): A mix between substack + tumblr. It's definitely not complete but gave me time to learn SupaBase & Postgres.
- [Smolcart.js](https://github.com/TinyboxSoftware/Smolcart.js): A semi-finished library used for adding Shopify products to cart via Javascript
- [Mykal.codes](https://github.com/MykalMachon/Mykal.Codes): This website! a blog- it's been rebuilt 4-5 times in different frameworks (Next.js, Gatsby, 11ty, now Astro)

## Books üìö
I use books more as a reference, than anything.

- [Flask Web Development](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/): I recently read this to learn about flask for work- it's great! Walks you through creating a modern-ish web app with Flask.
- [Increment Magazine](https://increment.com): A _very_ high quality magazine about software development. Lots of varied, and well done articles from different disciplines of software.

## Misc ‚öô
Other stuff I use on a regular basis

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://mdn.org): have you ever wanted docs for like every web api ever? this is it!
- [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org): Tonnes of really great courses (mostly on their youtube channel) and even certificate programs!
