The Mykal.Codes website, where I post about whatever I want.

## Main Features

- **🏠 Home page:** shows off recent posts
- **🤔 About page:** gives a brief intro on me and my background
- **✍🏻 Posts page:** archieve of all my posts sorted by date, and sortable by tag
- **📫 Contact page:** if you want to get ahold of me, go here!
- **⚒️ `/uses` page:** list of everything in my setup, and how I like it.

## Stack

The site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), and while it could technically be hosted anywhere, I use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) because of their CI, Functions, and Forms features.
